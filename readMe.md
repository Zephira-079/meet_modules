# Some Function I Use In Gmeet (for school)
- spaghetti code :)
- vague variables :(
- sometimes used :O
- shitty code :) 
- don't use to troll someone ain't funny okay? :<
### how to use?
- if (you have a trust issue with my shitty code) return
- join google meet (browser only)
- F12 (or inspect element)
- open your browsers console
- paste all of the code (either gmeet.js or sorting.js) into your browsers console
- try some functions i wrote in comments 

### is this documentation?

- **sort(1,4,3,10,7,5,6)** use to sort&chat number without counting from 1 - 1000 :)
- **gmeet** use for gmeeet of course
- **gmeet.exist("example").text()** use to chat&find similar text message in the chatbox
- **gmeet.people()** use to chat whose present in your gmeet meeting
- **gmeet.button(number)** use to mess some buttons idk 
- that's it <3

## some troubleshoot? wth xd
- if **gmeet.exist("some example").text()** doesnt work, try to click chatbox icon in youre google meet :)
- if **gmeet.people()** doesn't work, also try to click people icon and vice versa to other functions :(
- if you follow all instructions and it didn't work either read my code or "rm -rf gmeet" on your terminal, or just give up XD
